        <p id="introduction">Hey! My name is Mina Azab and I am currently located in Jersey City. I moved to Jersey City
            when I was 6 years old with my father, my mother, and my little brother. I would later gain another little brother.
            As a little joke, since we are all guys, we were all given names starting with the same letter, so we all have the
            same initials. I have lived in the same community since then. As crazy as it sounds, I have never moved from the
            apartment that my family lives in now. I love this fact because it allowed for my family to create so many different
            memories in this apartment. Living in Jersey City has exposed me to a lot of different cultures. Before moving to
            America, I was surrounded by people who shared my culture and my background. When I came to America, though,
            there were so many different people from so many different backgrounds. It was interesting to me and I began
            to absorb all of it in. I made a lot of friends from this experience. Looking back, it is interesting to
            think that the young boy who could not speak a single word of English in Kindergarden, is now speaking
            fluent English while learning different coding languages. This knowledge of different languages has not come
            without sacrifices though. When I came to America, I was able to speak fluent Arabic, but because I have
            been focused on learning English, I have not been using my native language as much as I want to. This has
            hurt my connection with family members who do speak Arabic (like my aunts, uncles, and counsins).
            Nonetheless, I am making efforts to relearn Arabic and reconnect to my culture.</p>
