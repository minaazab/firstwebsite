        <p id="academics_p">School! Wohoo! I attend Infinity Institute; a public magnet school. This school's building is very old. Nonetheless,
            there is a certain beauty to the 1900s building. There are jokes among the students (and teachers) about the
            condition of the building because of the amount of roaches in the building. You can't go a single week without
            seeing at least one dead roach. Nonetheless, the staff and the students are all amazing. Not only are the students
            smart, but the teachers are amazing at their jobs. My favorite teacher is a man named Mr. Arevalo. If I said that I
            loved school, I would be lying. School has its ups and downs. Overall, I like school because of the friends that I
            am able to interact with. There are a few classes that I thoroughly enjoy, though. These classes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>History</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>Physical Education</li>
        </ul>
